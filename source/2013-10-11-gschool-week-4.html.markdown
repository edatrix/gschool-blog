<h2>Week 4 retrospective</h2>

this week was Focus Week.  we were split into three self-identified groups and worked primarily with these small groups to either brush up or refine our skills.  i was in the Awesome (aka Emerging) Group.

our group spent a lot of time on bite-sized exercises that helped us tackle specific tasks.  we spent a lot of time understanding hashes, TDD, and parsing CSVs.  i feel much more comfortable with each of these skills than i did last week and will definitely refer back to these exercises as i start to incorporate these features into my own code.

working in small groups is nice and for specific things like learning hashes, i think it's an effective way to teach, but i don't think i'd want to be with just the small group for the whole six months.  larger groups provide more perspectives, personalities, and challenges.  i enjoy being given the opportunities to learn from and work with classmates at all levels, and i think this is much more like the real world.

next week, we move on to web applications.  i'm excited to see what i can build and how pushing things to the web differs from just running programs in the terminal.  i obviously <3 the internets, so learning to build things to put there is pretty darn exciting.
