<h2>week 8 retrospective</h2>

dinner dash!  our current project is a rails project in which we build an online ordering system for a restaurant.  i am working with Persa and Will on this project and we have until next Thursday to finish it.

i like Rails, but find it somewhat overwhelming right now because it does so much for you and i'm still unfamiliar with all of the methods and routes and "rails magic" that just happens behind the scenes.  my first experience with it was last weekend when i completed the quick Blogger assignment on my own, so it is still very new to me.  i can definitely see why it is so widely used, even by people who don't know Ruby at all, but i'm glad that i have at least some understanding of what is going on in the background.  it also makes sense to me now what people meant when they said that where Ruby allows for programming flexibility and creativity, Rails is much more rigid and clearly indicates what its creators consider a "right" and "wrong" way to do things.

our team is doing fine.  we've worked together for a fair amount of time, but are now starting to split work out a bit more.  Persa and Will are both patient and instructive if i ask them to be and we've not had any real issues, which is good.  we're moving foward at a steady, if slow-ish pace and using Pivotal tracker to manage tasks.  right now we've completed several tables and authentication and soon we'll begin putting these pieces together and making the project look better on the front end.  

when our group met on Day 1 to discuss how we'd like to work, timetable, expectations, etc., we all outlined what we'd like to learn or accomplish through this project.  my thoughts/goals were that i'd like to pair more at the beginning to be sure i understand everything that we're doing from the start rather than jumping in after completed pieces are put together, i'd like to own some part of the project start to finish, and while i'm open to doing front end stuff, i don't want to do it exclusively.  there is definitely a lot i can learn about front end development, but i'm here to learn Ruby and Rails and i don't want to get stuck with HTML on things just because my understanding of Ruby/Rails is not as stong as my teammates'.  this is not happening, just saying.  

my hope is that by next week we'll have something to show at the demo that we'll all be proud of and i think this is an attainable goal.  we might not have every piece of the project finished as outlined on the tutorial, but what we have will be complete and it will be good.  i'd much rather turn in a small-scale project that works and is really solid than a bunch of half-baked things slapped together just to say that we touched all of the extensions.  

this project is also making my hungry, which is a good thing since my doctor wants me to gain more weight.  browsing restaurant websites as homework is enough to make anyone reach for that bag of whatever and shovel it in.
