<h2>week 18 retrospective</h2>

with gSchool graduation moving closer every day, jobs and resumes are increasingly on our minds.  on my mind.

today we've been asked to write about our ideal job setup.  while i sort of hate this question (in reference to anything, not just a job) because my idea of perfection is constantly changing, i have obviously given some thought to the type of place i want to work post-gSchool.

after having moved so much in the past several years, i'd like to remain in the Denver/Boulder area, and as much as i've learned in the past months of gSchool, i know i still have worlds to learn about Ruby, Rails, and software development in general, so working at a place that helps to foster and even encourages growth as a developer is important to me.

i'm not wedded to the idea of working at one specific type of place (i.e. consultancy or a product company), but know that i want to work with smart, passionate people in a real team environment.  after having worked at both very small and very large places, i'd like to find a nice medium-sized company - larger than just a few people, but small enough that i'll not be lost in the numbers - where i can work with and learn from a team of people smarter than me.

it's come up a number of times that i might be a good fit as a Product Manager given my background and newly acquired skills, but i plan on searching for and taking a developer job.  that is, after all, why i came here.  down the road who knows what could happen, but for now there is just too much for me to learn to stop while i've really only just started.

on top of all of this, i hope to find a place that values a healthy work/life balance.  while i am not afraid of long hours and hard work, i do not believe that long hours necessarily *equal* hard work.  i love to be challenged, thrive under pressure, and would rather die than be bored.  when i find the right fit, i'll be happy to give my new job my all, but that means taking care of my personal needs so that i can do so.  spending time with my growing family, enjoying activities outside of work, and personally developing in other ways are all very important to me and will be on my mind as i consider potential jobs.
