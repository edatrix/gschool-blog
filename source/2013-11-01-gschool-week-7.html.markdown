<h2>week 7 retrospective</h2>

this week we tackled a smallish project called CloneWars using Sinatra, SQL, HTML/CSS, and, of course The Web.  it was the first project where we were assigned to groups of three and i was put with Meeka and Nikhil.

the assignment was to scrape a local website and recreate it.  though we quickly went over how to use Mechanize and Nokogiri in class, the website we chose to replicate was built in XHMTL frames and thus prevented us from scraping all of the code that we needed.  instead, i spent a lot of time manually gathering the code for each of the 18 pages we built.

our group worked together for the first few days, taking turns typing and walking through what was happening together, but we eventually broke out small pieces to work on individually.  Meeka did a lot of the heavy lifting when it came to building our database and Nikhil built the email form.  i spent a lot of time on front end stuff, formatting, inserting pieces of HTML from templates i liked, and making things look right on the page.  i wish i'd written more of the actual Ruby/Sinatra code, but my contributions were valuable.

we built tests in from the start, but did not get to acceptance tests.  we did, however, build unit and controller tests that allowed us to see more clearly what was working and what was not.

the way we built our page seems pretty different from the way a lot of other groups did, but i like what we did and think we learned a lot in doing so.  if we had more time, i think we'd create more tables for food and menu in order to make that information dynamic and of course we'd make the front end look better.

i enjoyed working in the three person group and i enjoyed my teammates on this project.  we worked well together, each contributing something different, and i thought that having an additional team member took a little pressure off of me.  at one point in the week, we all had to take off for a bit (doctor's appointment, airport pickup, etc.), but it was nice to know that if one of us was out, the other two were still working together.  on the other hand, adding a third made us each accountable to one more person.  if i didn't get my part finished, i wasn't just letting one person down, i was letting down two.  luckily for us, that didn't happen.
