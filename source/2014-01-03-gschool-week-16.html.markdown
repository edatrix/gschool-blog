<h2>week 16 *prospective*</h2>

56 days from now the program will be over.  wow.

we're supposed to look ahead this week rather than looking back and i suppose that's good since it's been a month since our last project and we're all still getting back into the groove of things post-holidays.

for the next 56 days my goals remain unchanged, though i plan on stepping it up as much as i can.  i want to learn as much as i can, whether through classroom lessons and group work on our current project or on my own; i want to increase my skill level, competence, and confidence in programming.  specifically, i'd like to:

<ul>
  <li>continue to work on pure Ruby</li>
  <li>learn more about and practice Javascript</li>
  <li>learn more about and practice jQuery</li>
  <li>contribute significantly to my team's current project, Runline</li>
  <li>start working on a MVP for my final project</li>
  <li>tackle more Exercisms</li>
</ul>

i'd also like to find a job in the next 56 days.  nbd.

as with most things, the biggest obstacle that stands in the way between here and a strong finish to gSchool is myself.  i don't feel that i'll be unsuccessful, but know that the level of my success depends largely on the time and effort i put in these next few weeks.  like everyone else, there are many other facets to my life besides gSchool that demand time and attention.  the next few weeks will require focus, motivation, and persistence, but i'm feeling good and am ready to work.
