<h2>Week 3 retrospective</h2>

<p>it's been a minute since my last post because at the end of last week we were all at Rocky Mountain Ruby.  i'm thankful for the opportunity to go to my first conference and mostly enjoyed myself.  though i didn't understand (or care about?) every speaker or topic, i enjoyed meeting new people, picking up the bits on information i could, and seeing a little bit of the broader Ruby world.<p>

<p>this week we've been back in class, working hard on the current project at hand, Sales Engine.  my partner for this project was Tyler.  i think we complimented each other pretty well, but could have made better use of our time.  he and i were a bit more closely matched in skill level than i was with my last partner and this helped.  along with having to non-work days for RMR, we had git/github issues which impeded our progress, and we weren't able to connect over the weekend.  again, we could have used our time more strategially.<p>

<p>all this said, i'm not unhappy with the progress we made.  i think some people feel differently about this than i do, but for me learning concepts and feeling like i'm personally advancing is more important than "completing" a project.  we might not have made it through all of the business logic and i might not be able to articulate exactly what is happening with 100% of the code, but i do feel like i learned and contributed something to this project, so that's a small win for me.<p>

<p>at this point in the program, i'm maybe a bit behind where i'd hoped to be, but i'm not terribly upset by that.  like everyone else, i have high expectations for myself, but i have too much going on right now to stop and be pissed or overwhelmed by what is not working.  instead, i'm focusing on the small wins and feel confident i'll get myself up to where i want to be (hopefully) soon.<p>
