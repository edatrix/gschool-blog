<h2>week 6 retrospective</h2>

another week behind us and we're now entering week 7 of gSchool.  last week was a flurry of activity as we had our first assessment, wrapped up IdeaBox, and then i skipped out on our first Code Retreat to go to a friend's wedding (which was awesome).

i'm happy to report that my IdeaBox turned out pretty well and that it's the first project i've completed and am kind of proud of.  i didn't get through all the extensions and it doesn't do anything crazy, but i enjoyed the work an am satisfied with the way it looks and with the functions that do work.  i had a very basic understanding of HTML before this, but even that little bit of knowledge helped me when it came to front end stuff (and Persa helped a lot).  it helped me a lot that the outline for this project was very explicit in explaining many of the steps and it made me feel a little more confident that i could work through the bulk of it on my own.  as i mentioned last week, i was happy to have a study group to go to when i did get stuck on something.

working with Sinatra was interesting and completely new to me, but i didn't hate it.  in fact, i kind of like the way there are very specific commands that do very specific things (e.g. PUTS, GETS, POST). i wasn't able to test as much as i would have liked with this project, but i did manage to get a few tests in there and i completed the TDD tutorial, though it doesn't exactly test my application.  i enjoyed the refactoring we did as a group led by Frank and will think about the things he had us do as i move forward with other projects.

if i were to start this one over, i would spend more time on testing, of course, and i would push myself harder on extensions.  i probably could have gotten more finished if i'd pushed myself a bit harder, but i spent maybe a little more time than i needed to on front end stuff and was just happy that i finished the thing at all.

i wasn't at the Code Retreat on Friday, but it sounds like it was a nice change of pace for everyone.  instead, i was at a wedding in Middleburg, VA, where i ate more in two days than i have in the entire past month, caught up with some of my favorite people, and took a little break from writing code.  i look forward to participating in the next Code Retreat.
