<h2>week 10 retrospective</h2>

no blog post last week because the class was at iTriage for a code retreat.  because i missed the last one, this was my first code retreat experience.  pretty interesting.

we had a problem to solve, Battleship, then worked in hour increments with a different partner and constraint each hour to make progress on the problem.  we went through four iterations of this.  

at first i was put off by the idea of looking at the same thing all day and starting from scratch at the top of each hour, but i did not hate it as much as i thought i would and got to work with four individuals i haven't ever worked with on a project, which was a good experience.  with each partner i worked with, we made progress in a slightly different way.  i enjoyed seeing the different approaches that people take to the same problem, and although i never got close to completing the task, i was happy that each time my partner and i were able to accomplish something by trying new things and working together.

i'm glad we stopped after four rotations because i think we were all pretty fried at that point after having also just finished Dinner Dash the day before, but i'm glad went and won't dread the next one now that i know what to expect.

and speaking of Dinner Dash...we did our first demos on this asssignment last week.  our group accomplished a lot in the last week of the project and i was very happy with both our final product and with our demo, which was, of course, the best.  our project didn't have every single bell and whistle that it could have, but it worked, it was nice to look at, and we started every piece that we finished.  i contributed in what i felt was a meaningful way and my teammates were great at helping me understand things i didn't understand, not just giving me trivial pieces of the project to work on, and communicating progress along the way.  i would definitely work with Persa or Will again.

this week was supposed to be a focus week, but instead turned into JavaScript week.  definitely important, i'm glad that we're getting a taste of JavaScript (and jQuery).  it's funny, when i started gSchool i thought that learning Ruby would be like learning a language, but it wasn't really.  to me it was more like learning a new process or skill, but now that i have a grip on Ruby (albeit unfirm), learning JavaScript does seem like learning a new language.  we're reading the same book, just in French now instead of English.

all this said, i am missing pure Ruby and have been trying to keep up on that by doing exercisms.  i gave my first lightening talk today on jQuery and would like to learn as much of this as possible.  ugh, there is just too much to learn in too short a time.
