<h2>Guest Speaker Nell Shamrell - Regular Expressions</h2>

Today we were lucky to have guest speaker Nell Shamrell talk to the class about Regular Expressions.  Nell, a software developer at Blue Box Group in Seattle, is an engaging speaker and a regular expression (regex) enthusiast.

During this talk, Nell covered the basics of regular expressions, helping us understand how regular expressions match patterns and begin to make sense of previously-incomprehensible expressions such as "/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/" and "/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/" by explaining how metacharacters work.  Nell also showed the class how useful Rubular can be when testing regular expressions.

Some of the more prominent regular expressions we learned were \d (all digits 0-9), \w (any word character), and a{3} (exactly 3 of a). There is a great quick reference of the top 40 at http://rubular.com/

Nell's talk was interesting and informative.  Her enthusiasm for regular expressions is contagious and we can't wait to learn more!
