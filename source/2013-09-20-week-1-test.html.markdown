<h2>Week 2 (week 1?) retrospective</h2>

<p>so i guess we're required to update this blog on the norm.  it's been a while since i maintained such a text-y blog with thoughts and feelings and more than just .gifs to express my emotions, but i suppose i'll give it a go.</p>


<p>at the end of this week, i'm annoyed with myself more than anything. i've not been feeling well and thus have not been physically able to put in the time i wish i could have to master concepts and contribute to projects.  in fact, i've barely touched Event Reporter, our first official project.  instead of working into the wee hours of the nights, i've spent much of this time crying and vomiting.  it's been really excellent.</p>

<p>projects, concepts, and tutorials we've been asked to work through thus far include:
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby in 100 Minutes</li>
    <li>Encryptor</li>
    <li>EventManager</li>
    <li>MicroBlogger</li>
    <li>EventReporter</li>
    <li>various Enums exercises</li>
    <li>TDD</li>
    <li>learning Github</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>i feel comfortable with about 1/3 of this material...</p>

  <p>i'm feeling much better today and hope to log some serious hours reviewing tutorials and fundamental concepts over the weekend.  i am fine with the pace of the class, pretty satisfied with instruction, and think i'm beginning to make some friends.  again, i'm annoyed with myself for not being where i want to be and not having contributed to my full potential, but i know what i need to do to become successful and am ready to do what it takes to make it work (o snap).  moving forward, i hope to spend much less time feeling shitty and more time building, breaking, and re-building things here.</p>
