<h2>week 12 retrospective</h2>

started a new project this week, Fourth Meal.  this project builds upon Dinner Dash and my group (Rolen and Darryl) has decided to use my Dinner Dash code base, Platable.

we're using Pivotal Tracker in a more serious way with this assignment.  it's not a bad thing to take a more serious approach to project management, but i'm still getting used to the tool.  it takes a fair amount of time to write the stories in the recommended style and requires you to look at both the big and small picture.  

since we're building on my former group's code base, i'm in a more comfortable position than i would be if we had taken on someone else's, but i'm not sick of the code and there's still a lot i can learn and do with it (especially the parts that i hadn't previously touched).

in addition to Fourth Meal, we kicked off a project with Young Entrepreneurs yesterday.  here, we are building websites for young people.  my kid's name is Hagan and he is 11 and he has a handmade card business.  this is a challenge for me in many ways...

but anyways.

we're now halfway through gSchool and we had a midpoint assessment last week.  mine was fine.  i feel ok about my progress, but of course there are lots of areas in which i could improve.  i wish there were more hours in the day to read, write code, work with my groups, and learn.
