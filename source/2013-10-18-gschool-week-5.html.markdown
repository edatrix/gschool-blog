<h2>week 5 retrospective</h2>

this has been a pretty good week.  i've been feeling physically better for the most part, i like the study groups we've been assigned to, and i feel good about the progress i've made on our current project, Idea Box.

building web applications is different from simply building command-line applications, but it's not really *that* different.  we're still creating classes and objects and methods that interact with one another, it's just that some of them look and act a little differently.  perhaps if i had a firmer grasp on how some of these things work in the first place i'd be saying otherwise, but from what i can tell it's pretty much the same (but different).  i am still at a point where i don't understand 100% of what is happening as i build my code, but i am gathering bits and pieces and putting them together as best as i can and i am enjoying this project.

i can't really compare this week to Focus Week because the nature of the work, the expectations, and the setup are so different, but as far as going from small exercises to a large individual project goes, i am satisfied with how i'm doing.  in fact, this will be the first project that i'll have completed thus far.  all by my big girl self, so i guess that's something to feel good about :)

like i mentioned, i really like the study groups we've been assigned to, and i appreciate that the instructors distributed people at all levels pretty equally among groups.  my group, Persa, Nathaniel, Adam, Nikhil, and myself, i think, is a pretty good representation of the skill levels found in our class.  each of us is working very independently on our projects, but we get together for kind of "study sessions" periodically where we all bring our questions to ask of each other (read: Nathaniel) and set goals for the next few days.  again, i'm pleased with the progress i'm making and beat my first goal (complete through I4) by a few days and was able to move on to the next step(s) sooner that i'd anticipated.  another reason i like the small group is because it gives me the chance to get some of the informal interaction that i think i sometimes miss becuase i typically leave school earlier than the rest of the class, so i'm not around for those late-night brainstorming sessions or aha moments that i know happen among my peers.

next week is our first assessment and i honestly don't know what to expect. of course i'm not where i want to be, but every day i feel a little bit better about my progress (i should probably set more concrete goals than "improve every week", so maybe i'll ask for some advice suring my next 1-on-1).  i am not sure what the assessment will look like (will it be a skills test?  a code review?  more LSAT questions [i wish]?), but i don't need an instructor to tell me where i am in the class or what i need to work on so i guess i'm ready to hear whatever good or bad they have to say.  i'm ot anticipating any surprises and frankly, it's just an assessment based on work i've done when not my best self, so from my perspective things can only get better from here.  what will my weak spots be?  um, Ruby.  strong spots?  my charming personality, of course.
